            <li>Features rchar and wchar have 1.27% and 0.84% of missing values. It can be imputed with median.</li>
            <li>lwrite,pgin and ppgin - features have 10% to 35% of Zeros in the datasets.</li>
			<li>pgout,ppgout,pgfree,pgscan and atch - These features have more than 50% of the data as Zeros</li>
			<li>lread, fork, exec, pflt and usr - These features have Zeros in the data sets ranging from 0% to 10%.</li>
            <li>The features with Zeros is a possibility in case of an idle system. Let us see when such features can attain Zeros:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> lwrite - If there are no active processes that require data to be transferred between system memory and user memory, then the number of transfers per second between system memory and user memory would be zero.</li>
                    <li> pgin - If all the pages required by the processes are already in memory, then there would be no need for the operating system to fetch any pages from disk, and the number of page-in requests per second would be zero.</li>
                    <li> ppgin - If all of the pages required by the running processes are already in memory, then there is no possibility for the operating system to load any pages from disk, and the number of pages paged in per second would be zero. This can occur when a process has a relatively stable memory usage pattern and the operating system is able to allocate enough memory to accommodate all of the required pages without needing to swap any out to disk.</li>
                    <li> pgout - Page out requests occur when the operating system needs to write data from memory back to disk to free up memory for other processes. If there is enough free memory available in the system, and no process requires more memory than what is available, then the number of page out requests per second would be zero.</li>
                    <li> ppgout - If there is enough free memory available, and all running processes have allocated the memory they require, then there would be no need to page out any pages to disk, and the number of pages paged out per second would be zero.</li>
                    <li> pgfree - If there are no processes running or if all the processes have allocated all the memory they need, then there would be no need to add pages to the free list, and the number of pages per second placed on the free list would be zero</li>
                    <li> pgscan - If the system has enough free memory and there are no processes that require additional memory. In such cases, the operating system's memory management algorithm may not need to check any pages for freeing, as there are no pages that need to be reclaimed. However, in most cases, some level of memory management is required to keep the system running smoothly, even if there are no active memory requests</li>
                    <li> atch - If there are no processes running or if all the required pages are already in memory, then there would be no need for page attachment, and the number of page attaches per second would be zero</li>
